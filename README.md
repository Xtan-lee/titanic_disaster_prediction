## Titanic Disaster Prediction ##

For this task I have prepared two solutions: 
- An ipynb notebook which contains analysis, visualisation, experiments and modelling.

- A modular adaptation of the ipynb using python scripts which are the standard for collaboration, versioning, and productionising models. 

**To run the ipynb**
1. Spawn an ipython kernel with python 3.11.7
2. Navigate to titanic_disaster_prediction\src\experiment_notebook.ipynb
3. Then run the cells

**To run the ML app**
1. Create and activate a venv with python 3.11.7
2. From titanic_disaster_prediction\src, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open command prompt or any shell
4. Navigate to  titanic_disaster_prediction\src\components
5. Run `python run_model.py`
